# My-First-Portfolio

## Summary
In this project, I created my first portfolio webpage. I added links which directly go to my project websites. Also I added my contact information with links to corresponding contact channels. I used advanced CSS for styling and used flex properties, such that the items within website are adjusted when the webpage is resized.
